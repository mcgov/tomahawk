Vectors are just arrays of items same as a List<Of T>

object* is basically just a type. A test* is a pointer to a "test" object in memory
you can make a pointer to an object ex: 'object' by adding the & symbol.
&object returns the address of that object in memory.

files are divided into .h and .cpp files. .h includes just the declarations, and function 'prototypes'.
these are included when you want to 'import' a file.

the .cpp files include all the details, initializations of data and implementations of functions and methods.
